<h2 id= "summer"> My Summer To-Do list </h2> 
<br>
<p id= "words"> The summer is almost here. Before June 4th stars, I have to think of what I want to do for the summer.
My top priority is to get all of my work for AP Art done and ready for next year. After that is taking driver's ed and gettng my license.
 I'm not the type to enjoy swimming or excessive exercise so my summer will be very laid back. I want to dye my hair a new color or try something 
 new with my sense of style. </P>
